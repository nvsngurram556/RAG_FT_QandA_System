Annexure-IV
Annual Report on CSR activities for the year 2023-24
1. Brief outline on CSR Policy of the Company
IRFC is committed to being a responsible corporate entity and recognizes its obligations towards all stakeholders through its
Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Policy (CSR & Sustainability Policy). As part of this policy, IRFC aims to support
sustainable development initiatives of the government, promote the preservation of the environment, and ensure a healthy future
for generations to come. The company also seeks to contribute to inclusive growth and equitable development in society by
empowering marginalized and underprivileged sections.
The development of IRFC's CSR & Sustainability Policy aligns with the provisions of the Companies Act 2013, including the
rules and regulations established under the Act, as well as the guidelines issued by the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE).
While selecting CSR activities under the company's schemes, IRFC adheres to its Board-approved policy and complies with the
provisions of the Companies Act 2013 and CSR Rules. The policy also outlines the format for submitting CSR proposals to the
company for consideration. To evaluate the received proposals in accordance with the CSR Policy and applicable laws, a General
Manager Committee has been formed. Shortlisted proposals are then presented to the CSR Committee of the Board for approval
and subsequent recommendation to the Board of Directors.
IRFC enters into Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with implementing agencies for the execution of CSR projects and
finalizes the terms as approved by the Board. Implementing agencies are required to submit periodic reports, as well as a project
completion report upon the completion of projects. If necessary, the implementing agencies may also be requested to provide
an impact assessment report.
Considering the limited manpower resources of the company, IRFC aims to undertake short-term sustainability-focused CSR
activities that can be completed within a single financial year. Additionally, whenever feasible, IRFC contributes to larger projects
by sharing resources with other Railway PSUs/Central PSUs to create greater environmental, social, and economic impacts. These
contributions are subject to the Rules and Regulations of the Companies Act 2013 and other applicable statutes, guidelines, if any.

New Delhi - 110003
We have examined the compliance of conditions of Corporate Governance by Indian Railway Finance Corporation Limited (IRFC/
Company) for the year ended March 31, 2024, as stipulated in the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 and Guidelines on Corporate Governance for Central Public Sector Enterprises, 2010
issued by Department of Public Enterprise (DPE Guidelines).
The compliance of conditions of Corporate Governance is the responsibility of the management of the Company. Our examination
has been limited to review of procedures and implementations thereof, adopted by the Company for ensuring the compliance of the
conditions of Corporate Governance as stipulated in the said clause and guidelines. It is neither an audit nor an expression of opinion
on the financial statements of the Company.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, we certify that the Company has
complied with the conditions of Corporate Governance as stipulated in the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations
& Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 and in DPE Guidelines, except that during the period under review the number of
Independent Directors on the Board was less than half of the total strength of Board as required under regulation 17(1) of Securities
and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations & Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 and in DPE Guidelines.
Company/IRFC has explained that IRFC being a Government Company, all the Directors are appointed by the President of India,
acting through administrative ministry, i.e., Ministry of Railways (MoR) and as such this is beyond the control of the Company. The
Company from time to time has requested MoR for appointment of requisite number of Independent Directors on its Board.
We further state that such compliance certificate is neither an assurance as to the future viability of the Company nor the efficiency or
effectiveness with which the Management has conducted the affairs of the Company.

Government of India. As per the lease agreements entered into between the Company and MOR, the Sales Tax/ VAT liability, if
any, on procurement/acquisition and leasing is recoverable from MOR. Since, there is no sales tax/ VAT demand and the amount
is unascertainable, no provision is considered necessary.
d. Director-General of GST Intelligence (DGGI), Chennai Zonal unit has served a show cause notice dated 16-4-2019 on the company
alleging contravention of the provision of sec 67,68 and 70 of the Finance Act, 1994 by the company and as to why service tax
of H26,537.65 million along with interest and penalty be not demanded from the company. The company has submitted a reply

above-stated sections of the Finance Act, 1994. Further, the company has also filed counter comments against the comments
given by the department and the hearing is going on. Management is of the view that the company is not liable to pay the tax.

e. The disputed demand of tax (including interest thereon) for the AY 2015-16 was Rs. 9.48 million. Against the said demand, the
company has filed a rectification application u/s 154. Based on the decisions of the Appellate Authority in similar matters and the
interpretation of relevant provisions, the Company is confident that the demand will be either deleted or substantially reduced,
and accordingly, no provision is considered necessary. However, the said demand of H9.48 million has been adjusted by the
department, out of the refund to IRFC for the AY 2016-17.
f. During the Financial year 2021-22, an intimation u/s 143(1) for AY 2019-20 was received from the CPC. In the said intimation, TDS

by Rs. 1462.42 million without any reason and additional tax and interest thereon has been raised. The demand of Rs. 2043.26
million has been adjusted against the refund claimed for AY 2020-21. Against the said demand issued by the CPC u/s 143 (1), an
appeal was filed at CIT (A) on 28-1-2022, which has considered TDS credit which was short granted and also made an addition of
Rs. 6135.12 million on account of income tax paid (the company has already added provision for tax in the computation of taxable
income) and Rs. 154790.38 million on account of General reserves, etc, in book profit, against which the company has filed an
appeal before the Honourable Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) on 17-4-23 for the total addition of Rs. 162387.93 million.

year 21-22. The Company filed an appeal before the Dy. Commissioner, State Tax, Appeal, Chennai on 22-02-24. At the personal
hearing conducted on 14-3-24, the company elucidated that the ITC was claimed in accordance with the GST law and adequate
amount of ITC is also available in the electronic credit ledger. The management holds the perspective that no provision is deemed
necessary in either scenario.

K) Sensitivity analysis of the defined benefit obligation
Below is the sensitivity analysis determined for significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of defined benefit
obligations and based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting
period while holding all other assumptions constant.

- Impact due to decrease of 0.50 % 14.67 12.98
Sensitivities due to mortality and withdrawals are not material and hence impact of change not calculated.
Sensitivities as to rate of inflation, rate of increase of pensions in payment, rate of increase of pensions before retirement & life
expectancy are not applicable being a lump sum benefit on retirement.

M) These plans typically expose the Company to Actuarial Risks such as Investment Risk, Liquidity Risk, Market Risk and
Legislative Risk.
Actuarial Risk It is the risk that benefits will cost more than expected. This can arise due to one of the following
reasons:
Adverse Salary Growth Experience: Salary hikes that are higher than the assumed salary escalation
will result into an increase in Obligation at a rate that is higher than expected.
Variability in mortality rates: If actual mortality rates are higher than assumed mortality rate
assumption than the Gratuity Benefits will be paid earlier than expected. Since there is no condition
of vesting on the death benefit, the acceleration of cash flow will lead to an actuarial loss or gain
depending on the relative values of the assumed salary growth and discount rate.
Variability in withdrawal rates: If actual withdrawal rates are higher than assumed withdrawal
rate assumption than the Gratuity Benefits will be paid earlier than expected. The impact of this will
depend on whether the benefits are vested as at the resignation date.
Investment Risk For funded plans that rely on insurers for managing the assets, the value of assets certified by the
insurer may not be the fair value of instruments backing the liability. In such cases, the present
value of the assets is independent of the future discount rate. This can result in wide fluctuations
in the net liability or the funded status if there are significant changes in the discount rate during
the inter-valuation period.
Liquidity Risk Employees with high salaries and long durations or those higher in hierarchy, accumulate
significant level of benefits. If some of such employees resign/retire from the company there can
be strain on the cash flows.

(All amounts in millions of H, unless stated otherwise)
Market Risk Market risk is a collective term for risks that are related to the changes and fluctuations of the
financial markets. One actuarial assumption that has a material effect is the discount rate. The
discount rate reflects the time value of money. An increase in discount rate leads to decrease
in Defined Benefit Obligation of the plan benefits & vice versa. This assumption depends on
the yields on the corporate/government bonds and hence the valuation of liability is exposed to
fluctuations in the yields as at the valuation date.
Legislative Risk Legislative risk is the risk of increase in the plan liabilities or reduction in the plan assets due to
change in the legislation/regulation. The government may amend the Payment of Gratuity Act thus
requiring the companies to pay higher benefits to the employees. This will directly affect the present
value of the Defined Benefit Obligation and the same will have to be recognized immediately in the
year when any such amendment is effective.

Adverse Salary Growth Experience: Salary hikes that are higher than the assumed salary

Variability in withdrawal rates: If actual withdrawal rates are higher than assumed withdrawal
rate assumption than the leave benefit will be paid earlier than expected. The impact of this will
depend on the relative values of the assumed salary growth and discount rate.
Variability in Availment rates: If actual Availment rates are higher than assumed Availment rate

L) These plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as Investment Risk, Liquidity Risk and Market Risk.
Actuarial Risk It is the risk that benefits will cost more than expected. This can arise due to one of the following
reasons:
Adverse Salary Growth Experience: Salary hikes that are higher than the assumed salary
escalation will result into an increase in Obligation at a rate that is higher than expected.
Variability in mortality rates: If actual mortality rates are higher than assumed mortality rate
assumption than the Employees' Family Benefit Scheme will be paid earlier than expected. Since there
is no condition of vesting on the death benefit, the acceleration of cash flow will lead to an actuarial loss
or gain depending on the relative values of the assumed salary growth and discount rate.
Variability in withdrawal rates: If actual withdrawal rates are higher than assumed withdrawal
rate assumption than the Employees' Family Benefit Scheme will be paid earlier than expected.
The impact of this will depend on whether the benefits are vested as at the resignation date.
Investment Risk For funded plans that rely on insurers for managing the assets, the value of assets certified by the
insurer may not be the fair value of instruments backing the liability. In such cases, the present
value of the assets is independent of the future discount rate. This can result in wide fluctuations
in the net liability or the funded status if there are significant changes in the discount rate during
the inter-valuation period.
Liquidity Risk Employees with high salaries and long durations or those higher in hierarchy, accumulate
significant level of benefits. If some of such employees resign/retire from the company there can
be strain on the cash flows.
Market Risk Market risk is a collective term for risks that are related to the changes and fluctuations of the
financial markets. One actuarial assumption that has a material effect is the discount rate. The
discount rate reflects the time value of money. An increase in discount rate leads to decrease in
Defined Benefit Obligation of the plan benefits & vice versa. This assumption depends on the yields
on the corporate/government bonds and hence the valuation of liability is exposed to fluctuations
in the yields as at the valuation date.

Legislative Risk Legislative risk is the risk of increase in the plan liabilities or reduction in the plan assets due to
change in the legislation/regulation. The government may amend the Payment of Gratuity Act thus
requiring the companies to pay higher benefits to the employees. This will directly affect the present
value of the Defined Benefit Obligation and the same will have to be recognized immediately in the
year when any such amendment is effective.

- Impact due to decrease of 10% 12.57 12.85
L) These plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as Investment Risk, Liquidity Risk and Market Risk.
Actuarial Risk It is the risk that benefits will cost more than expected. This can arise due to one of the following
reasons:
Adverse Salary Growth Experience: Salary hikes that are higher than the assumed salary
escalation will result into an increase in Obligation at a rate that is higher than expected.
Variability in mortality rates: If actual mortality rates are higher than assumed mortality rate
assumption than the Employees' Family Benefit Scheme will be paid earlier than expected. Since there
is no condition of vesting on the death benefit, the acceleration of cash flow will lead to an actuarial loss
or gain depending on the relative values of the assumed salary growth and discount rate.
Variability in withdrawal rates: If actual withdrawal rates are higher than assumed withdrawal
rate assumption than the Employees' Family Benefit Scheme will be paid earlier than expected.
The impact of this will depend on whether the benefits are vested as at the resignation date. "
Investment Risk For funded plans that rely on insurers for managing the assets, the value of assets certified by the
insurer may not be the fair value of instruments backing the liability. In such cases, the present
value of the assets is independent of the future discount rate. This can result in wide fluctuations
in the net liability or the funded status if there are significant changes in the discount rate during
the inter-valuation period.
Liquidity Risk Employees with high salaries and long durations or those higher in hierarchy, accumulate
significant level of benefits. If some of such employees resign/retire from the company there can
be strain on the cash flows.

38.2.2: Fair value measurements
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal (or
most advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market conditions, regardless of whether that price is directly
observable or estimated using a valuation technique.
In order to show how fair value have been derived, financial instruments are classified based on hierarchy of valuation techniques as
explained below:
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices
in markets that are not active) or indirectly (i.e. quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities);
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Set below is a comparison, by class, of the carrying amounts and fair value of the financial instruments. This table does not include the
fair value of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities.

For financial assets and financial liabilities that have a short term maturity (less than twelve months), the carrying amount which are net
of impairment, are a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Such instruments include: cash and cash equivalents, balance other
than cash and cash equivalents, trade payables, short term loans and borrowings.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The following table details the company's sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the INR against the relevant outstanding foreign
currency denominated monetary items. 10% sensitivity indicates management's assessment of the reasonable possible change in
foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts
their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or
equity where Rupee appreciates 10% against the relevant currency. A negative number below indicates a decrease in profit or equity
where the Rupee depreciates 10% against the relevant currency.

In management's opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk because the exposure at the
end of the reporting period does not reflect the exposure during the year.
38.6: Interest rate risk management
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk because it borrows funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk is managed
by the Company by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings. Company use financial instruments to
manage its exposure to changing interest rates and to adjust its mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt on long-term debt.
The Company's exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management
section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative
instruments at the end of the reporting period. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability
outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the whole year. A 50 basis point increase or decrease represents
management's assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/ lower and all other variables were held constant, the Company's:
i) Profit for the year ended 31 March 2024 would decrease/increase by Rs. 11029.71 millions (31 March 2023: decrease
increase Rs. 10,256.73 millions, 01 April 2022: decrease/increase Rs. 9,318.74 millions). This is mainly attributable to the
Company’s exposure to interest rates on its rate debt securities;
ii) Profit for the year ended 31 March 2024 would decrease/increase by Rs. 9744.32 millions (31 March 2023: decrease
increase Rs. 9,926.92 millions, 01 April 2022: decrease/increase Rs. 8,469.44 millions). This is mainly attributable to the
Company’s exposure to interest rates on its rate borrowings.
Interest Rate Benchmark Reform:
Exposure directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform as required by Ind-AS 107, para 24-I and 24-J
The total amount of exposure that is directly affected by Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (IBOR) i.e. after June 2023 is USD 3,300
million (Amount in H 2,77,357.32million) as on 31.03.2024. Out of this, the amount of the derivative exposure linked with such liabilities
and accounted for under hedge accounting is USD 225 million (Amount in H 3,130.70 million)

Significant assumptions for exposure affected by the interest rate benchmark reform
The alternative reference rate/benchmarks for the LIBOR linked loans and their derivatives have been agreed with the lenders and the
derivative bankers. As a result of such reform there has been no change in the relationship of the hedged items, hedged instruments
and its corresponding hedge effectiveness.
The hedge accounting relationships that are affected by the adoption of the temporary exceptions are presented in the balance sheet
in note 5, ‘Derivatives Financial Instruments’.
38.7: Other price risks
The Company has a small amount of investment in equity instruments, price risk of which is not considered material.
38.8: Credit risk management
Credit risk arises from the possibility that the counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the
company. To manage this, the Company periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial
conditions, current economic trends, and analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of accounts receivable.
The Company consider the probability of default upon initial recognition of assets and whether there has been a significant increase in
credit risk on an ongoing basis through each reporting period. To assess whether there is significant increase in credit risk, it considers
reasonable and supportive forward looking information such as:
(i) Actual or expected significant adverse change in business.
(ii) Actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the counterparty.
(iii) Financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the counterparty's ability to meet its obligation.
(iv) Significant increase in credit risk and other financial instruments of the same counterparty.
(v) Significant changes in the value of collateral supporting the obligation or in the quality of third party guarantees or
credit enhancements.
RBI vide its circular dated 13 March 2020 “Implementation of Indian Accounting Standards by Non-Banking Financial Companies and
assets Reconstruction Companies”, required the Board of Directors to approve sound methodologies for computation of Expected
Credit Losses (ECL). As such company has formed a ECL policy to manage its credit risk.
The Company's major exposure is from lease receivables from Ministry of Railways, Government of India and loans to Rail Vikas
Nigam Limited and IRCON International Limited which are under the control of Ministry of Railways. There is no credit risk on lease
receivables being due from sovereign. With respect to loan given to Rail Vikas Nigam Limited and IRCON International Limited,
the company consider the Reserve Bank of India MASTER DIRECTION – RESERVE BANK OF INDIA (NON-BANKING FINANCIAL
COMPANY –SCALE BASED REGULATION) DIRECTIONS, 2023), DOR.FIN.REC.NO.45/03.10.119/2023-24, DATED 19/10/2023, to be
adequate compliance with the impairment norms as per Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments, as IRCON International Limited and Rail
Vikas Nigam Limited, both, are under Ministry of Railways, Government of India and the Company do not expect any concern in the
repayment of aforesaid loans.
38.9: Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is defined as the potential risk that the Company cannot meet the cash obligations as they become due.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, which has established an appropriate liquidity
risk management framework for the management of the company's short, medium, and long-term funding and liquidity management
requirements. The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities, by continuously monitoring
forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Besides, there is a provision
in the lease agreements with the Ministry of Railways (MOR) whereby MOR undertakes to provide lease rentals in advance (to be
adjusted from future payments) in case the Company doesn't have adequate liquidity to meet its debt service obligations.

38.10: Derivative financial instruments
The Company holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in
exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The objective of hedges is to minimize the volatility of INR cash flows of highly probable
forecast transaction.
Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness
assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument, including whether the
hedging instrument is expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items.

cost of incremental borrowings made during the year plus the margin.
(e) The Leases executed for Rolling Stock in the year 1993-94, 1992-93,1991-92, 1990-91, 1989-90 and 1988-89 for Rs. 9003.80

iii Impact of material prior period adjustments
IRFC's principal business is to borrow funds from the financial markets to finance acquisition/creation of rolling stock/ project
assets which are then leased out to the Indian Railways (i.e., MoR).
IRFC is currently in the process of implementing the ERP. During the transition of data from the legacy system to the ERP, it was
observed that there was an overstatement by Rs. 7901.36 million in lease receivables, due to variances in capital recovery in the
terminal year of the lease agreements which have completed their primary lease period.
Accordingly, the lease receivables and retained earnings as at 1 April 2022 were overstated by H6202.79 million each. The error
has also resulted in reduction of profit for the year ended 31 March 2023 by H1698.57 million. The lease receivable and retained
earnings as at 31 March 2023 were overstated each by Rs. 7901.36 million and the comparitive figures as at 31 March 2023 and
01 April 2022 have been restated.
The error has been corrected by restating each of the affected financial statement line items for the prior periods as follows:
Increase/ 31 March 23 Increase/ 01-Apr-22

Since the total impairment allowances under Ind AS 109 is equal to the total provisioning required under IRACP (including
standard asset provisioning) as at 31 March 2024, no amount is required to be transferred to ‘Impairment Reserve’. The gross
carrying amount of asset as per Ind AS 109 and Loss allowances (Provisions) thereon includes interest accrual on net carrying
value of stage - 3 assets as permitted under Ind AS 109. While, the provisions required as per IRACP norms does not include any
such interest as interest accrual on NPAs is not permitted under IRACP norms.
The balance in the ‘Impairment Reserve’ (as and when created) shall not be reckoned for regulatory capital. Further, no withdrawals
shall be permitted from this reserve without prior permission from the Department of Supervision, RBI.
(ii) In terms of recommendations as per above referred notification, the Company has adopted the same definition of default for
accounting purposes as guided by the definition used for regulatory purposes.
As at 31 March 2024, there are no loan accounts that are past due beyond 90 days but not treated as impaired.

Requirements) Regulations, 2015 and Guidelines on Corporate Governance for Central Public Sector Enterprises, 2010 issued by Department
of Public Enterprise (DPE Guidelines).
The compliance of conditions of Corporate Governance is the responsibility of the management of the Company. Our examination has been
limited to review of procedures and implementations thereof, adopted by the Company for ensuring the compliance of the conditions of
Corporate Governance as stipulated in the said clause and guidelines. It is neither an audit nor an expression of opinion on the financial
statements of the Company.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, we certify that the Company has complied
with the conditions of Corporate Governance as stipulated in the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations & Disclosure

half of the total strength of Board as required under regulation 17(1) of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015, Companies Act 2013 and the

K) Sensitivity analysis of the defined benefit obligation
Below is the sensitivity analysis determined for significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of defined benefit obligations
and based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period while holding all
other assumptions constant.
As at As at
Particulars
31st March 2025 31st March 2024
a) Impact of the change in discount rate
- Impact due to increase of 0.50 % 2.10 1.44
- Impact due to decrease of 0.50 % 2.23 1.55
b) Impact of the change in salary increase
- Impact due to increase of 0.50 % 2.18 1.51
- Impact due to decrease of 0.50 % 2.14 1.47
Sensitivities due to mortality and withdrawals are not material and hence impact of change not calculated.
Sensitivities as to rate of inflation, rate of increase of pensions in payment, rate of increase of pensions before retirement & life
expectancy are not applicable being a lump sum benefit on retirement.

Expected contribution of the next year 0.17 0.14
M) These plans typically expose the Company to Actuarial Risks such as Investment Risk, Liquidity Risk, Market Risk and Legislative Risk.
Actuarial Risk It is the risk that benefits will cost more than expected. This can arise due to one of the following reasons:
Adverse Salary Growth Experience: Salary hikes that are higher than the assumed salary escalation will result
into an increase in Obligation at a rate that is higher than expected.
Variability in mortality rates: If actual mortality rates are higher than assumed mortality rate assumption than
the Gratuity Benefits will be paid earlier than expected. Since there is no condition of vesting on the death
benefit, the acceleration of cash flow will lead to an actuarial loss or gain depending on the relative values of
the assumed salary growth and discount rate.
Variability in withdrawal rates: If actual withdrawal rates are higher than assumed withdrawal rate assumption
than the Gratuity Benefits will be paid earlier than expected. The impact of this will depend on whether the
benefits are vested as at the resignation date.
Investment Risk For funded plans that rely on insurers for managing the assets, the value of assets certified by the insurer
may not be the fair value of instruments backing the liability. In such cases, the present value of the assets is
independent of the future discount rate. This can result in wide fluctuations in the net liability or the funded
status if there are significant changes in the discount rate during the inter-valuation period.
Liquidity Risk Employees with high salaries and long durations or those higher in hierarchy, accumulate significant level of
benefits. If some of such employees resign/retire from the company there can be strain on the cash flows.

(Amounts in H Crore, unless stated otherwise)
Market Risk Market risk is a collective term for risks that are related to the changes and fluctuations of the financial
markets. One actuarial assumption that has a material effect is the discount rate. The discount rate reflects
the time value of money. An increase in discount rate leads to decrease in Defined Benefit Obligation of the
plan benefits & vice versa. This assumption depends on the yields on the corporate/government bonds and
hence the valuation of liability is exposed to fluctuations in the yields as at the valuation date.
Legislative Risk Legislative risk is the risk of increase in the plan liabilities or reduction in the plan assets due to change in the
legislation/regulation. The government may amend the Payment of Gratuity Act thus requiring the companies
to pay higher benefits to the employees. This will directly affect the present value of the Defined Benefit
Obligation and the same will have to be recognized immediately in the year when any such amendment is
effective.

Actuarial Risk It is the risk that benefits will cost more than expected. This can arise due to one of the following reasons:
Adverse Salary Growth Experience: Salary hikes that are higher than the assumed salary escalation will result
into an increase in Obligation at a rate that is higher than expected.
Variability in mortality rates: If actual mortality rates are higher than assumed mortality rate assumption

L) These plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as Investment Risk, Liquidity Risk and Market Risk.
Actuarial Risk It is the risk that benefits will cost more than expected. This can arise due to one of the following reasons:
Adverse Salary Growth Experience: Salary hikes that are higher than the assumed salary escalation will result
into an increase in Obligation at a rate that is higher than expected.
Variability in mortality rates: If actual mortality rates are higher than assumed mortality rate assumption
than the Employees' Family Benefit Scheme will be paid earlier than expected. Since there is no condition of
vesting on the death benefit, the acceleration of cash flow will lead to an actuarial loss or gain depending on
the relative values of the assumed salary growth and discount rate.
Variability in withdrawal rates: If actual withdrawal rates are higher than assumed withdrawal rate assumption
than the Employees' Family Benefit Scheme will be paid earlier than expected. The impact of this will depend
on whether the benefits are vested as at the resignation date.
Investment Risk For funded plans that rely on insurers for managing the assets, the value of assets certified by the insurer
may not be the fair value of instruments backing the liability. In such cases, the present value of the assets is
independent of the future discount rate. This can result in wide fluctuations in the net liability or the funded
status if there are significant changes in the discount rate during the inter-valuation period.
Liquidity Risk Employees with high salaries and long durations or those higher in hierarchy, accumulate significant level of
benefits. If some of such employees resign/retire from the company there can be strain on the cash flows.
Market Risk Market risk is a collective term for risks that are related to the changes and fluctuations of the financial
markets. One actuarial assumption that has a material effect is the discount rate. The discount rate reflects
the time value of money. An increase in discount rate leads to decrease in Defined Benefit Obligation of the
plan benefits & vice versa. This assumption depends on the yields on the corporate/government bonds and
hence the valuation of liability is exposed to fluctuations in the yields as at the valuation date.
Legislative Risk Legislative risk is the risk of increase in the plan liabilities or reduction in the plan assets due to change in the
legislation/regulation. The government may amend the Payment of Gratuity Act thus requiring the companies to
pay higher benefits to the employees. This will directly affect the present value of the Defined Benefit Obligation
and the same will have to be recognized immediately in the year when any such amendment is effective.

38.2.2: Fair value measurements
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal (or most
advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market conditions, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or
estimated using a valuation technique.
In order to show how fair value have been derived, financial instruments are classified based on hierarchy of valuation techniques as
explained below:
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices in
markets that are not active) or indirectly (i.e. quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities);
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Set below is a comparison, by class, of the carrying amounts and fair value of the financial instruments. This table does not include the fair
value of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities.

38.5: Foreign currency risk management
The Company undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
The carrying amounts of the Company’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of the reporting
period are as follows.
Liabilities Assets
Particulars As at As at As at As at

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The following table details the company's sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the INR against the relevant outstanding foreign
currency denominated monetary items. 10% sensitivity indicates management's assessment of the reasonable possible change in foreign
exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation
at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or equity where
Rupee appreciates 10% against the relevant currency. A negative number below indicates a decrease in profit or equity where the Rupee
depreciates 10% against the relevant currency.
As at 31 March 2025 As at 31 March 2024
Particulars INR strengthens INR weakening INR strengthens INR weakening
by 10% by 10% by 10% by 10%
Profit or (loss) 6,621.19 (6,621.19) 6,884.79 (6,884.79)
In management's opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk because the exposure at the end
of the reporting period does not reflect the exposure during the year. Further the gain/(loss) on account of exchange rate variations on all
foreign currency loans and foreign currency monetary items along with hedging cost is recoverable from MoR as per the lease agreements
executed with them.
38.6: Interest rate risk management
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk because it borrows funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk is managed by the
Company by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings. Company use financial instruments to manage its
exposure to changing interest rates and to adjust its mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt on long-term debt.
The Company's exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management
section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative
instruments at the end of the reporting period. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability
outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the whole year. A 50 basis point increase or decrease represents
management's assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/ lower and all other variables were held constant, the Company's:
i) Profit for the year ended 31 March 2025 would decrease/increase by H 1184.81 crore (31 March 2024: decrease/increase H 1,102.97
crore). This is mainly attributable to the Company’s exposure to interest rates on its rate debt securities;

ii) Profit for the year ended 31 March 2025 would decrease/increase by H 875.59 crore (31 March 2024: decrease/increase H 974.43
crore). This is mainly attributable to the Company’s exposure to interest rates on its rate borrowings.
Interest Rate Benchmark Reform:
Exposure directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform as required by Ind-AS 107, para 24-I and 24-J
The total amount of exposure that is directly affected by Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (IBOR) i.e. after June 2023 is USD 3,300 million
(Amount in H 28,556.94 crore) as on 31.03.2025. Out of this, the amount of the derivative exposure linked with such liabilities and accounted
for under hedge accounting is USD 225 million (Amount in H 328.17crore)

Managing the process of transition to alternative benchmark rates.
The Standard ISDA IBOR Fallback Protocol has been followed by the Company for transition from USD LIBOR to alternate reference rate/
benchmark. For certain facilities, the Company has executed bilateral agreements with the lender to transition from USD LIBOR. For these
bilaterally negotiated agreements, the Company has negotiated slight alterations in certain standard terms mentioned in the ISDA IBOR
Fallback Protocol for operational purposes.
Significant assumptions for exposure affected by the interest rate benchmark reform
The alternative reference rate/benchmarks for the LIBOR linked loans and their derivatives have been agreed with the lenders and the
derivative bankers. As a result of such reform there has been no change in the relationship of the hedged items, hedged instruments and its
corresponding hedge effectiveness.

The hedge accounting relationships that are affected by the adoption of the temporary exceptions are presented in the balance sheet in
note 5, ‘Derivatives Financial Instruments’.
38.7: Other price risks
The Company has a small amount of investment in equity instruments, price risk of which is not considered material.
38.8: Credit risk management
Credit risk arises from the possibility that the counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the company.
To manage this, the Company periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial conditions, current
economic trends, and analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of accounts receivable.
The Company consider the probability of default upon initial recognition of assets and whether there has been a significant increase in credit
risk on an ongoing basis through each reporting period. To assess whether there is significant increase in credit risk, it considers reasonable
and supportive forward looking information such as:
(i) Actual or expected significant adverse change in business.
(ii) Actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the counterparty.
(iii) Financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the counterparty's ability to meet its obligation.
(iv) Significant increase in credit risk and other financial instruments of the same counterparty.
(v) Significant changes in the value of collateral supporting the obligation or in the quality of third party guarantees or credit enhancements.
RBI vide its circular dated 13 March 2020 “Implementation of Indian Accounting Standards by Non-Banking Financial Companies and assets
Reconstruction Companies”, required the Board of Directors to approve sound methodologies for computation of Expected Credit Losses
(ECL). .As such company has formed a ECL policy to manage its credit risk.
The Company’s major exposure is from lease receivables from the Ministry of Railways, Government of India; lease receivables from NTPC
Limited; and loans to Rail Vikas Nigam Limited, IRCON International Limited which are under the control of Ministry of Railways, and NTPC
Renewable Energy Limited. There is no credit risk on lease receivables being due from sovereign. With respect to the lease receivables from
NTPC Limited and loans given to Rail Vikas Nigam Limited, IRCON International Limited, and NTPC Renewable Energy Limited, the Company
considers the Reserve Bank of India Master Direction – Reserve Bank of India (Non-Banking Financial Company – Scale Based Regulation)
Directions, 2023 [DOR.FIN.REC.NO.45/03.10.119/2023-24 dated 19/10/2023] to be adequate compliance with the impairment norms as
per Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments, as these entities are either under the Ministry of Railways or are public sector undertakings backed
by the Government of India. The Company does not expect any concern regarding the repayment of the aforesaid loans.
38.9: Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is defined as the potential risk that the Company cannot meet the cash obligations as they become due.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, which has established an appropriate liquidity
risk management framework for the management of the company's short, medium, and long-term funding and liquidity management
requirements. The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities, by continuously monitoring
forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Besides, there is a provision in the
lease agreements with the Ministry of Railways (MOR) whereby MOR undertakes to provide lease rentals in advance (to be adjusted from
future payments) in case the Company doesn't have adequate liquidity to meet its debt service obligations.

38.10: Derivative financial instruments
The Company holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in
exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The objective of hedges is to minimize the volatility of INR cash flows of highly probable
forecast transaction.
However, the gain/(loss) on account of exchange rate variations on all foreign currency loans and foreign currency monetary items along
with hedging cost is recoverable from MoR as per the lease agreements executed with them.
Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments
to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument, including whether the hedging instrument
is expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items.

Note 41: Other Disclosures
(a) Lease rental is charged on the assets leased from the first day of the month in which the Rolling Stock assets have been identified and
placed on line as per the Standard Lease Agreements executed between the Company and MOR from year to year.
(b) Ministry of Railways (MOR) charges interest on the value of the assets identified prior to the payments made by the Company, from
the first day of the month in which the assets have been identified and placed on line to the first day of the month in which the money
is paid to the MOR. However, no interest is charged from the MOR on the amount paid by the company prior to identification of
Rolling stock by them.
(c) (i) Interest rate variation on the floating rate linked rupee borrowings and interest rate and exchange rate variations on interest
payments in the case of foreign currency borrowings are adjusted against the lease income/ pre-commencement lease income
in terms of the variation clauses in the lease agreements for Rolling Stock/ memorandum of understanding (MoU) for funding of
Infrastructure assets executed with the Ministry of Railways. During the year ended 31 March 2025, such differential has resulted
in an amount of H 3617.34 crore refundable to the Company ( 31 March 2024: H 3,658.20 crore, refundable to the Company)
which has been accounted for in the lease income/pre-commencement lease income.
(ii) In respect of foreign currency borrowings, which have not been hedged, variation clause have been incorporated in the lease
agreements specifying notional hedging cost adopted for working out the cost of funds on the leases executed with MOR.

account on notional cost basis and accordingly, the same is adjusted against the lease income. During the year ended 31 March
2025 in respect of these foreign currency borrowings, the Company has recovered a sum of H1,536.32 crore (31 March 2024:
H 1,583.54 crore) on this account from MOR against a sum of H Nil crore (31 March 2024: H Nil crore) incurred towards hedging
cost and the balance amount of H1,536.32 crore (31 March 2024: H 1,583.54 crore ) is refundable to MOR.
(d) For computing the Lease Rental, in respect of the rolling stock assets acquired and leased to the Ministry of Railways amounting to
H Nil crore during the period ended 31st Mar 2025 (31st Mar 2024: H Nil crore), the Lease Rental Rate and the Internal Rate of Return
have been worked out with reference to the average cost of incremental borrowings made during the year plus the margin.
(e) The Leases executed for Rolling Stock in the year 1994-95, 1993-94, 1992-93,1991-92, 1990-91, 1989-90 and 1988-89 for
H 1050.10 crore, H 900.38 crore, H 961.82 crore, H 1,500.49 crore, H 1,170.04 crore, H 1,072.56 crore & H 860.73 crore have expired
on 31 March 2025, 31 March 2024, 31 March 2023, 31 March 2022, 31 March 2021, 31 March 2020 & 31 March 2019 respectively.

Note 43:
(a) (i) The Finance Act, 2001 provides for the levy of service tax on the finance and interest charges recovered through lease rental
instalments on the Financial Leases entered on or after 16-07-2001. The Central Government vide Order No.1/1/2003-ST

Agreements entered into between the Company and the Ministry of Railways from the levy of Service Tax thereon u/s 93(2) of
the Finance Act, 1994.

including wagons, coaches, locos) by Indian Railways Finance Corporation to Indian Railways from the levy of Goods & Service Tax
(GST), Notification No. 12/2017 (Heading 9973) which has been made applicable with effect from 1 July, 2017. Vide notification

The preparation of financial statements of Indian Railway Finance Corporation Limited for the year ended 31 March 2025 in accordance
with the financial reporting framework prescribed under the Companies Act, 2013 (Act) is the responsibility of the management of the
Company. The statutory auditor appointed by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India under Section 139(5) of the Act is responsible for
expressing opinion on the financial statements under Section 143 of the Act based on independent audit in accordance with the standards on
auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act. This is stated to have been done by them vide their Audit Report dated 28 April 2025.
I, on behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, have conducted a supplementary audit of the financial statements of Indian
Railway Finance Corporation Limited for the year ended 31 March 2025 under Section 143(6)(a) of the Act. This supplementary audit has
been carried out independently without access to the working papers of the statutory auditors and is limited primarily to inquiries of the
statutory auditors and company personnel and a selective examination of some of the accounting records.
On the basis of my supplementary audit nothing significant has come to my knowledge which would give rise to any comment upon or
supplement to Statutory Auditor’s report under Section 143(6) (b) of the Act.
For and on the behalf of the
